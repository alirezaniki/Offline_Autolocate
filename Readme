Now it is possible to process several sources (mseed file and Archives) at the same time. 
Just put them in Input directory and follow the Tips.

Please consider the following TIPS:
1- Creat the following directoris right beside the main script:
Input, Output, BackUP, PROCESS

2- Specify the proper path for Parent directories and set the configs in main script. 

3- Put all your input data (mseed file or archive) in Input directory
3-1 All mseed files must have .mseed postfix (e.g. file.mseed)
3-2 All archives must contain a file in their main directory named "time.conf" including the
desired time span in <YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss~YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss> format.

4- You must have NonLinLocation installed and configured for relocation process.

Feel free to contact me in case of any problems.
