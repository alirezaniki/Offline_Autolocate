Now it is possible to process several sources (mseed file and Archives) at the same time. 
Just put them in Input directory and follow the Tips.

Please consider the following TIPS:
1- Specify the proper paths for Parent directories in the main script.

2- Put all your input data (mseed file or archive) in ./Input directory
2-1 All mseed files must have .mseed postfix (e.g. file.mseed)
2-2 All archives must contain a file in their main directory named "time.conf" including the
desired time span in <YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss~YYYY/MM/DD hh:mm:ss> format.
